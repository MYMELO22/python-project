With the EV market rapidly evolving, it's essential to understand the growth trends in charging facilities and sales to inform strategic planning. As a data scientist working for a leading EV charging network operator, you recognize the potential in this data and start wrangling and visualizing the aggregated yearly data. \n\nThis yearly data captured in December of each year encompasses a record of EV charging port installations and station localities spanning roughly ten years, capturing both public and private charging environments. The data is stored in two CSV files:\n___\n\n`private_ev_charging.csv`\n\n| Variable   | Description                                          |\n|------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| `year` |  Year of data collection |\n| `private_ports`| The number of available charging ports owned by private companies in a given year  |\n| `private_station_locations`   | The number of privately owned station locations for EV charging\n\n___\n\n`public_ev_charging.csv`\n \n| Variable   | Description                                          |\n|------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| `year` |  Year of data collection  |\n| `public_ports`| The number of available charging ports under public ownership in a given year  |\n| `public_station_locations`   | The number of publicly owned station locations for EV charging\n\n___\n\nThe sales information is available for each model and year in the `ev_sales.csv` file:\n\n| Variable   | Description                                          |\n|------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| `Vehicle` |  Electric vehicle model |\n| `year`| Year of data collection |\n| `sales`   | The number of vehicles sold in the US","metadata":{},"id":"d0e3f658-b4eb-44fe-ae85-76eeef3c4abd","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"# Import required libraries\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\n# Start your code here!","metadata":{"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":1132,"lastExecutedAt":1699630272874,"lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"# Import required libraries\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\n# Start your code here!"},"id":"bff36b1c-38f2-4a2c-8e4e-3d357b56fa21","cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"name":"Welcome to DataCamp Workspaces.ipynb","provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.8.10"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
